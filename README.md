# AdventureBit-MicroBit-Project

A small educational game to showcase potential uses of the BBC MicroBit.

This project also worked as a method of teaching Python to team members with limited programming experience.

#Note:
A lot of design patterns could not be employed when creating project due to limitations of the hardware. Only a single small python file could be compiled and run on the hardware, thus limiting modularity and complexity of the project.
